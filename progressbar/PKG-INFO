Description: Text progress bar library for Python.
        
        A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
        running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.
        
        The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
        is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
        differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are three types
        of widgets:
         - a string, which always shows itself
        
         - a ProgressBarWidget, which may return a different value every time its
           update method is called
        
         - a ProgressBarWidgetHFill, which is like ProgressBarWidget, except it
           expands to fill the remaining width of the line.
        
        The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
        automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.
