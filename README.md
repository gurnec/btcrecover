*btcrecover* is an open source Bitcoin wallet password and seed recovery tool. It is designed for the case where you already know most of your password or seed, but need assistance in trying different possible combinations.


## Quick Start ##

To try recovering your password, please start with the **[Password Recovery Quick Start](TUTORIAL.md#btcrecover-tutorial)**.

If you mostly know your recovery seed/mnemonic (12-24 recovery words), but think there may be a mistake in it, please see the **[Seed Recovery Quick Start](docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md)**.
