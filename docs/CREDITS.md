Thanks to Bitcointalk.org user Wotan777 who discovered a better way to work with Electrum 1.x wallets, and who made *extract-electrum-halfseed.py* possible.

Thanks also to JetBrains, developers of the excellent [PyCharm integrated development environment for Python](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The PyCharm IDE is the first (and last) IDE I turn to for my Python needs.
